Rest Assured is a group of java libraries which enables us to automate Rest API testing.
Rest Assured is Java-based, and knowledge of core Java suffices for learning it.
It helps fetch values of request and response from complicated JSON structures.                         
Rest Assured enables you to test REST APIs using java libraries and integrates well with Maven.
It has very efficient matching techniques, so asserting your expected results is also pretty straight forward.
Rest Assured has methods to fetch data from almost every part of the request and response no matter how complex the JSON structures are.             
The API request can be customized with a variety of header, query, path param, and any session or cookies to be set.
Rest Assured, helps us pass every part(query, path, header param) separately, making the code more readable and easy to maintain.
Also, we can parameterize the data from an external file as required.
It helps set assert statements and conditions.
While Rest Assured is very helpful when the response is JSON type, itâ€™s methods may not work seamlessly if content type id HTML or plain text.
methods may not work seamlessly if content type id HTML or plain text.                   
The syntax of Rest Assured.io is the most beautiful part, as it is very BDD like and understandable.
One of the basic rules of automation is that we have to put checkpoints so that the test proceeds only if all the required conditions are met.                
In API testing, the most basic validation is to check if the status code of the request is in 2XX format.
At times, you need the request to fail as well, and then you might use 4XX or 5XX. 
A very important feature of testing APIs is their response time, to measure the performance of the application.
Note that the time taken for a call may take more or less time depending on your internet speed, the performance of the API at that time, 
server load, and other factors impacting the time.
